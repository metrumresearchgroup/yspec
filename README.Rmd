Use yspec to document analysis data sets and utilize data attributes in a 
modeling and simulation workflow.

## Installation

You can install the development version of yspec from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("metrumresearchgroup/yspec")
```

## Create a yspec object

Before or while programming an analysis data set, write out data definitions
in [yaml](https://yaml.org/) format:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(yspec)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

readLines("inst/internal/analysis1.yml")[1:20] %>% writeLines()
```

Now use yspec to read that into a object in R

```{r example}
spec <- ys_load("inst/internal/analysis1.yml")
```

Query this object to get a sense of what is in the data overall

```{r}
head(spec)
```

or on a column by column basis for continuous data

```{r}
spec$WT
```

as well as categorical data

```{r}
spec$BLQ
```

And we can render a `define.pdf` file as well


```{r, include = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width = 600, out.height = 558.85}
knitr:::include_graphics("man/figures/define.png")
```

## Using yspec

This section illustrates a few examples for how yspec might be used 
(other than creating `define.pdf`). 

To make it easier to get started with yspec, we've included example data and 
corresponding yspec object in the package

```{r}
data <- ys_help$data()
spec <- ys_help$spec()
```


### Add factors

When you have discrete data, "decodes" can be provided and used to create 
factors in the data. We have that for the RF column

```{r}
spec$RF
```

Now we'll have a column called `RF_f` which is a factor version of `RF`
```{r}
ys_add_factors(data, spec, RF) %>% count(RF, RF_f)
```

### Recode

Every column can have a "short" name; for `WT` it is 

```{r}
spec$WT$short
```

Every continuous data can also have a unit; again for `WT`
```{r}
spec$WT$unit
```

We use the spec to "recode" using this information. First create a data summary
in long format

```{r}
summ <- 
  data %>% 
  select(WT, ALB, AGE) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(value), Sd = sd(value))

summ  
```

To recode, pull the information from `spec`

```{r}
summ %>% 
  mutate(name = ys_recode(name, spec,  unit = TRUE, title_case = TRUE))
```

## Manipulating yspec

There are several functions for working on your yspec object


Select some columns
```{r}
body_size <- ys_select(spec, WT, BMI, HT)

body_size
```

Filter based on some `flags` that were set

```{r}
ys_filter(spec, covariate)
```

Rename

```{r}
spec %>% ys_select(BWT = WT, AGE, SCR) 
```

## Projects

An analysis project typically has several data sets that can be documented 
together. We make a project like this

```{r}
pk   <- ys_load("inst/spec/DEM104101F_PK.yml")
pkpd <- ys_load("inst/spec/DEM104101F_PKPD.yml")
ae   <- ys_load("inst/spec/DEM104101F_AE.yml")
```

```{r}
proj <- ys_project(pk, pkpd, ae)
proj
```

This object can be rendered into a single `define.pdf` document.
